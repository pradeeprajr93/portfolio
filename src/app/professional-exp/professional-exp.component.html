        Designed good number of <b>Explainer and Motion Graphic videos</b> for various use cases in banking, travel and shopping
        domains. <br> Provided with the script, my duty is to come up with attractive visuals for the complete script and
        get it approved by the team before animating the visuals. <br> Videos will strictly follow the brand guidelines,
        color scheme and styles based on the client requirement. <br> Primary tool will be <b>Adobe Creative Cloud Suite.</b>        <br> Visuals are crafted using <b>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop</b>. Animation will happen inside <b>Adobe After Effects</b>.
        <br> In this time, I've also got a chance to lead a team of 3 designers and help them when they are stuck.
